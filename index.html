  <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>

 <p>An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked 
  to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.</p>

  <h3>Preparation time</h3>

  <p>Total: Approximately 10 minutes</p>
 <p>Preparation: 5 minutes</p>
<p>Cooking: 5 minutes</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <p>2-3 large eggs</p>
  <p>Salt, to taste</p>
  <p>Pepper, to taste</p>
  <p>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</p>
  <p>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <p>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
  You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</p>

  <p>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</p>

  <p>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
  the eggs evenly coat the surface.</p>

  <p>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
  middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</p>

  <p>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
  fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</p>

  <p>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</p>
